"""Data analysis from silicone phantom experiments 12/08/2021.

    Recorded single pulse/acquisition with different setups
    with (water?) filled silicone phantom; no other objects.

    Used 10x sine wave packet and single rectangular pulse.

    TODO - 1usec duration rectangular pulse may be wrong- it might 
            need to be 0.5usec == 1/2 period of transducer center frequency...
            DOUBLE CHECK THIS!
